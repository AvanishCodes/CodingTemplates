### Here are some templates of String Algorithms. Before making your PR, please check if it exists in some other category.

1. [Naive Pattern Matching](1.cpp)
2. [Alphanumeric Palindromes](2.cpp)
3. [Longest palindromic substring](3.cpp)
4. [Tries for searching string](4.cpp)
5. [Sliding Window Search](5.cpp)
6. [Rabin karp Pattern Search](6.cpp): to search a pattern in a string of low probability.
7. [Z-Algorithm](7.cpp): Linear Time pattern searching algorithm.
> - **Idea**: find the longest substring starting at any index in text string which is also a prefix of the pattern string.
8. [Add characters in the begining to make a string palindrome](8.cpp)
9. [KMP Algorithm for pattern searching](9.cpp)
